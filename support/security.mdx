# Security

FLTR takes security seriously. This page outlines our security practices, compliance certifications, and how we protect your data.

## Data Encryption

### In Transit

All data transmitted to and from FLTR is encrypted using **TLS 1.3** (Transport Layer Security):

- API endpoints only accept HTTPS connections
- HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS
- TLS 1.2 and below are not supported
- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) enabled

### At Rest

All data stored in FLTR databases and file systems is encrypted using **AES-256**:

- Database encryption at rest
- File storage encryption (documents, embeddings)
- Encrypted backups
- Secure key management with automatic rotation

### Encryption in Processing

- Documents are encrypted during processing pipelines
- Embedding generation uses encrypted memory
- Temporary files are encrypted and securely deleted

## Authentication & Access Control

### Authentication Methods

FLTR supports multiple authentication methods with varying security levels:

| Method | Security Level | Rate Limit | Recommended For |
|--------|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| API Keys | High | 1,000/hour | Server-to-server |
| OAuth 2.1 + PKCE | Very High | 15,000/hour | User applications |
| Session Cookies | High | 15,000/hour | Web applications |

### API Key Security

**Best Practices:**
- Store keys in environment variables, never in code
- Rotate keys every 90 days
- Use separate keys for development and production
- Revoke compromised keys immediately

**Key Format:**
```
fltr_sk_live_abc123...  (Production)
fltr_sk_test_xyz789...  (Testing)
```

### OAuth Security

FLTR implements **OAuth 2.1** with **PKCE** (Proof Key for Code Exchange):

- Authorization Code flow with PKCE required
- No implicit flow support (deprecated for security)
- Short-lived access tokens (1 hour)
- Secure refresh token rotation
- Scope-based permissions

## Access Control

### User Permissions

FLTR uses role-based access control (RBAC):

**Roles:**
- **Owner** - Full account access, billing, user management
- **Admin** - Manage datasets, documents, API keys
- **Developer** - Create and query datasets
- **Viewer** - Read-only access to datasets

**Permissions Matrix:**

| Action | Owner | Admin | Developer | Viewer |
|--------|-------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Create datasets | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Upload documents | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Query datasets | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Delete datasets | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manage API keys | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Billing & invoices | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### OAuth Scopes

Fine-grained permissions for OAuth applications:

```
datasets:read       - View datasets
datasets:write      - Create/update datasets
datasets:delete     - Delete datasets
documents:read      - View documents
documents:write     - Upload documents
documents:delete    - Delete documents
mcp:query          - Search datasets
webhooks:manage    - Manage webhooks
account:read       - View account info
```

- Audit logs: 1 year (enterprise), 90 days (standard)

**Deleted Data:**
- Soft delete: 30 days (recoverable)
- Hard delete: Permanent after 30 days
- Backups: Encrypted, 90-day retention

**Delete everything:**
```bash
# Delete specific dataset
DELETE /v1/datasets/{dataset_id}

# Delete your entire account
DELETE /v1/account
```

### Data Backup

- **Automated backups** every 6 hours
- **Point-in-time recovery** up to 30 days
